# Home page section photos

The home page renders a grid of large "image windows", one per section. Each
window shows a branded gradient fallback until a real photo is present here,
then the photo fades in automatically — no code change needed.

## Specs

- **Format:** `.jpg` (or re-point the code to `.webp`)
- **Orientation:** landscape; the big Players/Teams cards are ~3:2, the rest wider
- **Resolution:** ~1600px wide is plenty
- **Weight:** compress to roughly ≤300 KB each (these ship with the PWA)
- **Licensing:** make sure each image is licensed for use

The title, kicker and stat chip sit over a dark scrim at the bottom of every
card, so busy or bright photos still keep the text readable.

The page banner that reuses the same file is a wide letterbox using
`object-fit: cover`, so crop to landscape before dropping a file in rather
than leaving it to CSS. Artwork carrying its own headline is a poor fit here:
the banner prints the section title over the top, so the words collide and the
lettering gets sliced mid-glyph. `preview.jpg` is cropped to the tactics-board
half of its source card for exactly that reason.
